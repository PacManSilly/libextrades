                    <p class="text-xs text-slate-400 font-normal md:text-sm">
                        A cryptocurrency like bitcoin is a virtual currency traded peer-to-peer on a blockchain, independent of centralized
                        authorities like banks and governments. Cryptocurrencies are entirely virtual, so they are not backed by physical
                        commodities and have no intrinsic value.

                    <h3 class="text-bold text-sm text-white md:text-lg">How Do Cryptocurrencies Work?</h3>
                    <p class="text-xs text-slate-400 font-normal md:text-sm">
                        Primarily, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to complete a transaction via an intricate P2P network.
                        Once a transfer request is entered into the network, it is validated by the network and added to a pool of other
                        transactions to create a block of data for the ledger, which is then entered into the existing blockchain. Once
                        the block is successfully added to the chain, the transaction is approved and completed.

                    <p class="text-xs text-slate-400 font-normal md:text-sm">
                        Absolutely. Cryptocurrencies have become established investment commodities among major financial institutions
                        and have even been adopted by countries such as Australia and Japan. As with any investment though, there are
                        risks linked to market movements, high volatility and economics.
